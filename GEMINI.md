# Gemini Project Brief: Market Intelligence Platform

This document outlines the strategic vision, architecture, and development roadmap for the Market Intelligence Platform. It serves as a persistent context for the Gemini assistant.

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal is to build an enterprise-grade platform that fetches real-time financial data (stock quotes, news), analyzes it using AI to derive insights and sentiment, and potentially executes trades based on this analysis. The platform will be accessible via a web-based dashboard.

## 2. Core Components & Architecture

The system will be architected as a set of independent microservices with clear responsibilities. This is crucial as the data fetched is a shared resource for multiple backend components.

*   **`api-gateway`**:
    *   **Responsibility**: The single entry point for fetching data from all external sources (e.g., Finnhub for stocks, NewsAPI for news).
    *   **Role**: Acts as the "Single Source of Truth" for raw market data, providing a clean, internal API for other services. It prevents data-fetching logic from being duplicated.

*   **`web-ui`**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Provides a user-facing dashboard to visualize market data and analysis.
    *   **Role**: Consumes data from the `api-gateway` and other internal services to present to the user. It is primarily a data consumer and presenter.

*   **`analyzer-service` (Future)**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Consumes data from the `api-gateway`, applies AI/ML models to analyze sentiment and generate insights.
    *   **Role**: The core intelligence of the platform.

*   **`trading-service` (Future)**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Executes buy/sell orders on a brokerage platform.
    *   **Role**: Acts on signals generated by the `analyzer-service`.

## 3. Development Roadmap: "Crawl, Walk, Run, Fly"

We will follow an evolutionary architecture model to manage complexity and deliver value quickly.

### Phase 1: The Local Prototype (Crawl)
*   **Goal**: Build a functional, multi-service application running locally in Docker Compose.
*   **Current Status**: We are at the **beginning of this phase**.
*   **Next Steps**:
    1.  Build the `api-gateway` service to fetch and provide data.
    2.  Build a basic `web-ui` service that calls the `api-gateway` to display data.
    3.  Configure `docker-compose.yml` to run both services.

### Phase 2: Cloud Foundation (Walk)
*   **Goal**: Deploy the application to a foundational cloud environment.
*   **Plan**: Use Terraform to provision an AWS EC2 instance and an RDS database. Deploy the containers manually as a first step.

### Phase 3: Resilient Microservices (Run)
*   **Goal**: Evolve into a fully automated, scalable, and resilient microservices architecture.
*   **Plan**: Use Terraform to provision AWS SQS for message-based communication and EKS for container orchestration. Implement a full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

### Phase 4: Production-Grade Operations (Fly)
*   **Goal**: Implement elite SRE practices and advanced features.
*   **Plan**: Deploy observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana), harden security (AWS Secrets Manager), optimize costs (EC2 Spot Instances), and add advanced features like canary deployments.
